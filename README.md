## Overview
Most Senior citizens and physically challenged people are stuck at home due to the pandemic. A large fraction of them are stuck alone at home, making it difficult for them to get by. Our App aims to make their lives easier by providing a means for them to seek help from volunteers for tasks like 
* Buying and delivering essentials and medicines
* Domestic assistance
* An accident or emergency at home, considering the fact that emergency services in our country are super slow to respond.
